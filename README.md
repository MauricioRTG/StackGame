A game inspired by the popular mobile game Stack using Unreal Engine 5. The objective of the game is to win as many points as possible without letting the moving cube fall. If the player doesnâ€™t place the cube in the same position as the last cube, the cube will shrink by the size of the overlapping area with the previous cube. This game helped me improve and show my C++ programming skills in Unreal Engine 5.
